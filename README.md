- 👋 Hi, I’m @paulmrice-72
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, creating and integrating APIs, and Fantasy Football
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Razor, Web APIs, and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can be helpful with.
- 📫 How to reach me - if you want to find me bad enough you can.
- 😄 Pronouns: seriously?
- ⚡ Fun fact: have a lot of project ideas that have taken a back seat because I have spent my career as a VB.NET/SQL Server desktop developer - learning modern web development could open a lot of opportunity to explore some product ideas.
